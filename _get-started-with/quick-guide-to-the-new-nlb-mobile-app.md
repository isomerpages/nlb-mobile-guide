        <label for="acc10">How many eBooks / Audiobooks can I borrow?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>Each member can borrow up to 16 eBooks / Audiobooks. You can check your quota by selecting ‘Account’, then ‘eBook Loans’ in the app. </p>

		Note: eMagazines do not contribute to your eBooks loan quota. For example, if you borrowed 14 eMagazines and 8 eBooks, your loan quota in the NLB Mobile app will show “Borrowed 8/16”. You can borrow an unlimited number of eMagazines.

<input type="checkbox" id="acc11">
        <label for="acc11">How do I borrow eBooks / Audiobooks with this app?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
 <p>Follow these simple steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> In the app, search for the titles you want. Tap on the eBooks or Audiobooks tab near the top of the screen (see circled part of screenshot below). </p>
	<table style="width: auto;">
<tbody>
<tr>

	</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong>Tap on your desired title.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> If you have signed in using your myLibrary username, you can select ‘Borrow’ on the title details page. If you see a “Reserve” button, it means that all the copies are currently on loan and you have to join a waitlist. eBook reservations are free, while there is a fee to reserve physical items.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> If you have successfully borrowed the title, you will be prompted to choose among these options: continue browsing (for other books), read / listen in browser (online), or <a href="/get-started-with/libby/">read in Libby</a> (to download the book for reading/listening offline).</p>
<p>You may view all your borrowed eBook / Audiobook titles by selecting the ‘Account’ icon on the bottom right corner of the app, then ‘eBook Loans’.

<input type="checkbox" id="acc12">
		<label for="acc12">How do I read the eBooks or listen to the Audiobooks that I have borrowed?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
 <p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step One:</b> In the app, select the ‘Account’ tab on the bottom right corner, then ‘eBook Loans’ and tap on the title you want to read or listen to. </p>
<p><b>Step Two:</b> You will see a ‘Read in Browser ’ option for eBooks or a ‘Listen in Browser’ option for audiobooks. Select this option to read / listen online immediately within the app. </p>
<p><em>Please note: Reading or listening online will tap on your mobile data allowance if you are not connected to WiFi, and may incur charges from your telco.</em></p>
<p>If you wish to read or listen offline, you may select the <a href="/get-started-with/libby/">‘Read in Libby’</a> option. The app will automatically launch a free third-party app, Libby, to download the title. If you do not have the Libby app, the NLB Mobile app will prompt you to install it.</p>
