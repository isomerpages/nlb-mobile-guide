<!--Section on Borrowing physical items, eBooks and Audiobooks-->

<input id="acc8" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc8">How can I borrow physical items with the NLB Mobile app?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
	  <p>First, sign in with your myLibrary ID.</p> 
      <p>Next, tap on the camera icon at the bottom of the app to launch the “Scan-to-Borrow” function. Use the in-app camera to scan the NLB barcode on the library item. In the Feb 2021 release of the app, we added nifty features to the scan-to-borrow screen – now you can switch your profile in this screen, and check if you have previously borrowed the title.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you prefer to use the Borrowing Stations at libraries, use the “eCard”. Go to your profile (this icon is at the top right corner of the NLB Mobile app).  Your virtual membership card will appear. Scan the membership QR code at the Borrowing Station to borrow the library items.</p>

<input id="acc9" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc9">Does scanning the barcode of the library item with the app immediately trigger a checkout?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>No, the app will seek your confirmation before the item is checked out.</p>
</div>

<input id="acc10" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc10">How many eBooks / Audiobooks can I borrow?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>Each member can borrow up to 16 eBooks / Audiobooks. You can check your quota by selecting ‘Account’, then ‘eBook Loans’ in the app. </p>
	<table border="0">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><div style="max-width: 400px"><img alt="A screenshot from the app, showing the Account tab, where one would find the 'eBook Loans' button." height="800px" src="/images/App-Bookshelf-eBookLoans-quota.png"></div></td>

	</tr>
		</tbody></table>
	<p>
		Note: eMagazines do not contribute to your eBooks loan quota. For example, if you borrowed 14 eMagazines and 8 eBooks, your loan quota in the NLB Mobile app will show “Borrowed 8/16”. You can borrow an unlimited number of eMagazines.
	</p>
</div>

<input id="acc11" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc11">How do I borrow eBooks / Audiobooks with this app?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
<p>Follow these simple steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> In the app, search for the titles you want. Tap on the eBooks or Audiobooks tab near the top of the screen (see circled part of screenshot below). </p>

</table>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong>Tap on your desired title.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> If you have signed in using your myLibrary ID, you can select ‘Borrow’ on the title details page. If you see a “Reserve” button, it means that all the copies are currently on loan and you have to join a waitlist. eBook reservations are free, while there is a fee to reserve physical items.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> If you have successfully borrowed the title, you will be prompted to choose among these options: continue browsing (for other books), read / listen in browser (online), or <a href="/get-started-with/Libby/">read in Libby</a> (to download the book for reading/listening offline).</p>
<p>You may view all your borrowed eBook / Audiobook titles by selecting the ‘Account’ icon on the bottom right corner of the app, then ‘eBook Loans’.
	</p>
</div>

<input id="acc12" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc12">How do I read the eBooks or listen to the Audiobooks that I have borrowed?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
 <p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step One:</b> In the app, select the ‘Account’ tab on the bottom right corner, then ‘eBook Loans’ and tap on the title you want to read or listen to. </p>
<p><b>Step Two:</b> You will see a ‘Read in Browser ’ option for eBooks or a ‘Listen in Browser’ option for audiobooks. Select this option to read / listen online immediately within the app. </p>
<p><em>Please note: Reading or listening online will tap on your mobile data allowance if you are not connected to WiFi, and may incur charges from your telco.</em></p>
<p>If you wish to read or listen offline, you may select the <a href="/get-started-with/Libby/">‘Read in Libby’</a> option. The app will automatically launch a free third-party app, Libby, to download the title. If you do not have the Libby app, the NLB Mobile app will prompt you to install it.</p>
</div>

<input id="acc13" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc13">How do I return eBooks / Audiobooks?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>One of the most convenient features of borrowing eBooks / Audiobooks is that they will be returned automatically after 21 days. But if you are done with them before the 21-day loan period is up, you can also return them earlier so that another person can enjoy them sooner.</p>
<p>Just go to the ‘Account’ tab on the bottom right corner, then ‘eBook Loans’, and select the title you wish to return. You will see the option to ‘Return Title Early’ under the title’s cover image.</p>
</div>

<input id="acc14" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc14">How do I reserve eBooks and/or audiobooks?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
     	  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you will see a "Reserve" option in the NLB Mobile app, instead of the "Borrow" button. Reservations for eBooks and audiobooks are free. You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. You will receive a notification in the Libby app or your email when it is your turn to borrow. If you have turned off notifications in Libby's settings or if you don't have the Libby app, we will send you an email. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days. </p>
<p>Once notified, you have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a target="_blank" href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a target="_blank" href="https://nlb.overdrive.com">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>
</div>

<input id="acc15" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc15">How do I cancel a reservation?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
	<p>If you wish to cancel a <b>physical item</b> reservation, go to the 'Account' tab on the bottom right corner of the NLB Mobile app. Select "Reservations". Tap on the "Select Reservations to Cancel" button, and select the title(s) you don't wish to reserve anymore. Tap on the "Cancel Item(s)" button.</p>
	<p>If you wish to cancel an <b>eBook or audiobook reservation</b>, go to the 'Account' tab on the bottom right corner of the NLB Mobile app. Select "eBook Reservations". Tap on the title you don't wish to reserve anymore, and select "Cancel Reservation". You could select "Suspend Reservation" instead if you still want the book, but not anytime soon. The app will allow others to borrow the book first for the duration you select - from 1 week to 90 days. After that period has passed, you will automatically re-join the queue at the same position or better. If, later on, you change your mind and want the book ASAP, you can go back to this menu and change the timeframe to "Immediately".</p>
</div>

<input id="acc16" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc16">Why do some of your eBooks have limited copies?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
			<p>
			The publishers require that each eBook copy is only lent to one user at a time - much like a physical book. This business model assures publishers and creators that they will be paid as fairly for digital copies as they are for physical copies. You can <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0720.html">read about the details in an article</a> from our eBooks vendor, OverDrive.</p>
			<p>If there aren’t any copies available, you can select “Place Hold” or “Reserve” and you will be alerted once it is available. We constantly monitor the waiting lists per title and buy more copies, as far as our budget allows.</p>
			<p>To find books that are available right now, you can <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb">look in the "Available" categories</a> in the Libby website or app.</p>
			<p>In addition, eMagazines like The Economist (Asia Edition), Readers' Digest, WIRED, HELLO!, and Home &amp; Decor  are always available. Go to the <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/guide/magazines">Libby website or app</a> to see the full list of eMagazines and borrow them.</p>
			<p>We acquire unlimited copies of certain popular titles for a limited period, whenever opportunities arise. For updates, follow us at @publiclibrarysg on our social media channels (we're on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/publiclibrarysg/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/publiclibrarysg/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/publiclibrarysg">Medium</a>).

<div id="enews"><p></p><h4>Reading eMagazines/ eNewspapers</h4><p></p>
<input id="acc17" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc17">How do I read eMagazines/ eNewspapers from NLB Mobile?  </label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
	<h5>Reading SPH Local eNewspapers</h5>
<p>If you wish to read local newspapers such as The Straits Times, there are two ways of doing so. The first method is to  install the NLB Mobile app and sign in with a myLibrary ID. Next, tap on the SPH icon. Choose the eNewspaper you would like to read. Alternatively, while you are at the libraries, sign in to Wireless@SGx, then access the PressReader app. The difference between the two methods is that in the first method, you will read the digitised newspaper in your browser. In the second method, you can download the newspaper into the PressReader app to read offline.</p>
<p>If you have questions about SPH Local eNewspapers (e.g. how to zoom in), check out <a href="/get-started-with/enews/">our FAQ page</a>.</p>
        <p></p><h5>Reading International eNewspapers and eMagazines</h5><p></p>
<p>NLB Mobile lets you read over 7,000 current eNewspapers and eMagazines from local and international publishers.</p>
<p>First, install the NLB Mobile app and sign in with a myLibrary ID. Next, tap on the ‘eMagazines &amp; eNewspapers’ icon. Because this is a service we subscribe from PressReader, an international digital newsstand, you will be prompted to download the PressReader app if you do not have it. When you launch the PressReader app through NLB Mobile, you can get complimentary access (this is called ‘sponsored access’ in PressReader) to these local and international publications. Do note that this sponsored access is for one hour only. Don’t worry, when the hour is up, you can launch NLB Mobile and tap on the ‘eMagazines &amp; eNewspapers’ icon to get sponsored access again. </p>
<p>
	We also have some eMagazine titles not found in PressReader, e.g. The Economist (Asia Edition). You can borrow this title directly from the <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/guide/magazines">Libby website or app</a>.
	</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="/get-started-with/enews/">how to access eNewspapers and eMagazines</a>.</p>
<p style="endnote">Note: eMagazines and eNewspapers do not contribute to the loan quota, which you can check from the NLB Mobile app by going to the “Account” tab on the bottom right corner, then “eBook Loans”. For example, if you borrowed 14 eMagazines and 8 eBooks, your loan quota in the NLB Mobile app will show “Borrowed 8/16”.  You can borrow an unlimited number of eMagazines and eNewspapers.</p>

<input id="acc24" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc24">What are Reservation Lockers?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
      <p>Reservation Lockers are located at all library branches (except library@chinatown) where patrons can pick up their reserved items. Patrons will be notified via email, SMS, and/or on their NLB Mobile app when the items are ready for collection.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the Reservations for Collection screen, the patron will see the list of reserved items that are ready for collection grouped according to the lockers in which they are placed. If the patron is at a particular library (or within 500m radius of it), the lockers of that library would be displayed at the top. Following this, the patron would see lockers from their preferred libraries. The rest are sorted in alphabetical order according to the names of the library branch and the names of the locker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> When the patron arrives at the locker in the specified library branch, tap on the Open Locker button. If the item to be collected is age-restricted, the patron will have to verify their account by entering their password.</p>
