<label for="acc7">Can I download local newspapers published by SPH Media such as <i>The Straits Times, Business Times</i> and <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i> into my device?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
		<p>You have to use the PressReader app to download SPH Media newspapers. Do note that these newspapers are not available for <b>download</b> <u>outside of NLB library premises</u> in Singapore due to the geographic restriction set by the publisher.</p>
<p>If you only wish to read SPH Media newspapers <b>online</b> instead of downloading them, you don't have to be at the library and can read them from <u>anywhere</u>, by logging in with your myLibrary ID at <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/sphnewspapers">go.gov.sg/nlb-enews</a>. 
</p>
<p>To download SPH Media newspapers using the PressReader app, make sure you are <u>onsite</u> at NLB’s libraries with your device, and that your device is <b>connected to NLB's Wireless@SGx</b> networks. </p>
		<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
		<p>Connect your device to the Wireless@SGx network in the library.</p>
		<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
		<p>Launch the PressReader app directly (or go to the NLB Mobile app and tap on the "eNewspapers and eMagazines" icon).</p>
		<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
		<p>Search for the newspaper you want. Tap on the downwards arrow next to the name of the newspaper, or tap on the green "Read" button to download it. To access past issues, tap on the cover of the newspaper, then the calendar icon.</p>
<p>Anything you download in the PressReader app can be accessed using the "Downloaded" button at the bottom of the PressReader app. You can download as many SPH Media newspapers as you want <b>when you are at the libraries</b>, just as long as your device has enough storage for the downloaded content. You can then continue to read the downloaded content even when you are away from the library premises.</p>

<div class="new-accordion-content">
    <p>There are many ways! If you are reading from your mobile device, the best way is through the NLB Mobile app. If you are reading from your computer or laptop, use your Internet browser. If you want to read local newspapers too, you have to access PressReader at our libraries.</p>
<p>Here are the details of each access mode:</p>
