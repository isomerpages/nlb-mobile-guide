<h4>Downloading Local Newspapers</h4>
<input id="acc7" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc7">Can I download local newspapers published by SPH Media such as <i>The Straits Times, Business Times</i> and <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i> into my device?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
		<p>You have to use the PressReader app to download SPH Media newspapers. Do note that these newspapers are not available for <b>download</b> <u>outside of NLB library premises</u> in Singapore due to the geographic restriction set by the publisher.</p>
<p>If you only wish to read SPH Media newspapers <b>online</b> instead of downloading them, you don't have to be at the library and can read them from <u>anywhere</u>, by logging in with your myLibrary ID at <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/sphnewspapers">go.gov.sg/nlb-enews</a>. 
</p>
<p>To download SPH Media newspapers using the PressReader app, make sure you are <u>onsite</u> at NLB’s libraries with your device, and that your device is <b>connected to NLB's Wireless@SGx</b> networks. </p>
		<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
		<p>Connect your device to the Wireless@SGx network in the library.</p>
		<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
		<p>Launch the PressReader app directly (or go to the NLB Mobile app and tap on the "eNewspapers and eMagazines" icon).</p>
		<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
		<p>Search for the newspaper you want. Tap on the downwards arrow next to the name of the newspaper, or tap on the green "Read" button to download it. To access past issues, tap on the cover of the newspaper, then the calendar icon.</p>
<p>Anything you download in the PressReader app can be accessed using the "Downloaded" button at the bottom of the PressReader app. You can download as many SPH Media newspapers as you want <b>when you are at the libraries</b>, just as long as your device has enough storage for the downloaded content.

<h4>Magazine titles on PressReader and Libby</h4>
<div class="new-accordion">
<input id="acc6a" type="checkbox">
	<label for="acc6a">I heard that NLB has The Economist. Where is it available? </label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
		<p><b>The Economist is accessible via NLB’s PressReader subscription, for both onsite and remote access. NLB members may also access PressReader via the NLB Mobile app, by simply tapping on “eNewspapers &amp; eMagazines” icon.</b></p>

<p>As of 1 February 2023, Overdrive is no longer offering The Economist due to changes in the publisher’s access model. </p>

<p>PressReader offers both digital newspapers and magazines while Libby currently only offers magazines, but no newspapers. There will be some overlaps in the both collections.</p>
  

</div>

<input id="acc6b" type="checkbox">
<label for="acc6b">What is the difference between Libby's eMagazines and PressReader's eNewspapers and eMagazines?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
		<p>
			</p><p>PressReader offers both digital newspapers and magazines. Libby has magazines, but not newspapers. The magazine collection in the two apps overlap. Here are some titles found in <b>Libby</b> and not PressReader:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Economist</li>
			<li>The Hollywood Reporter</li>
			<li>The New Yorker</li>
			<li>Bon Appetit</li>
			<li>Wired</li>
			<li>New Scientist</li>
			<li>National Geographic</li>
			<li>Gramophone</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		    If you want any of the above titles, go to Libby. <a rel="noopener" href="/get-started-with/libby/#mag">Click here for the Libby guide.</a>
		    </p>
		<p>
		    The other key difference is that once downloaded, you get to keep PressReader magazines in your device for as long as you want. Libby Magazines are automatically returned after 21 days. After that, just borrow again if you still want them.
