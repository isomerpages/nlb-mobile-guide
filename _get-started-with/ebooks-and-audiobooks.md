<li>Always connected? Read online with the <a href="/get-started-with/nlb-mobile/">NLB Mobile app</a>. Titles that you borrow on Libby will appear on your NLB Mobile app, and vice versa. 
 </li>
</ul>

<label for="acc2">What is the difference between Libby and NLB Mobile?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks and audiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> lets you easily check your account and access our resources. You can borrow eBooks / Audiobooks, access eNewspapers / eMagazines and online courses. </p><p>While NLB Mobile lets you read or listen to eBooks / Audiobooks while you are connected to the Internet, it does not have an in-built reader for you to read downloaded eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive, a global distributor of content for libraries and schools. You can borrow and download NLB's eBooks / Audiobooks, so that you can enjoy them even when you are offline. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch&nbsp;a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>

<input type="checkbox" id="acc10">
<label for="acc10">Why does NLB Mobile ask me to install Libby when I choose to download an eBook / Audiobook?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>NLB Mobile is designed for access and transactions. It lets you borrow and read or listen to eBooks / Audiobooks online, but does not have a built-in reader for downloaded eBooks / Audiobooks. Installing Libby will let you read downloaded eBooks in a user-friendly interface.

<div class="new-accordion-content">
<p>Go to your Shelf in Libby and look at the icon next to the book title. If there is a tick next to the title, it's been downloaded on your device for offline use.</p>
<p>If there's a cloud icon next to the title, it hasn't been downloaded on your device. It'll be streamed when you open it, requires an internet connection to read or listen to, and doesn't take up space on your device.</p>

<label for="acc6a">How can I renew the eBooks / audiobooks? </label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
  <p>You can renew a title a few days before it's due using these steps:<br>
Go to Shelf.<br>

<label for="acc6">There are no more copies available for the title I want. Can I reserve it for free? How do I know when it is my turn to borrow it?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
    	  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge by selecting the "Place Hold" option in Libby.  You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. You will receive a notification in your phone when it is your turn to borrow. If you have turned off notifications in Libby's settings or if you don't have the Libby app, we will send you an email. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days. </p>
<p>Once notified, you have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>
<p>If you fear you may have missed a notification, check your Shelf or Holds in the Libby app. To ensure that your notifications get through, do check your notification settings in Libby (<a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6174.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here to learn how to setup or manage notifications</a>). </p>
</div>

<input type="checkbox" id="acc7i">
<label for="acc7i">Why do some of your eBooks have limited copies?</label>
<div class="new-accordion-content">
			<p>
			The publishers require that each eBook copy is only lent to one user at a time - much like a physical book. This business model assures publishers and creators that they will be paid as fairly for digital copies as they are for physical copies. You can <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0720.html">read about the details</a> here from our eBooks vendor, OverDrive.</p>
			<p>If there aren’t any copies available, you can select “Place Hold” or “Reserve” and you will be alerted once it is available. We constantly monitor the waiting lists per title and buy more copies, as far as our budget allows.</p>
			<p>To find books that are available right now, you can browse "Available" categories in Libby, such as <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/curated-1119234/page-1">this list of popular but available books for adults</a>. In any category in Libby, you can also filter out unavailable books by tapping on Refine &gt; Available Now. We also have this special category called Skip the Line, where you can immediately borrow popular books which otherwise have very long waiting lists. You can borrow such special copies for 7 days. The list is ever-changing and exciting, and you can <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/curated-1029173/page-1">check it out here</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, eMagazines like Readers' Digest, Wired, HELLO!, National Geographic and The Economist are always available. <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/guide/magazines">See the full list</a> and borrow them.</p>
			<p>We acquire unlimited copies of certain popular titles for a limited period, whenever opportunities arise. For updates, follow us at @publiclibrarysg on our social media channels (we're on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/publiclibrarysg/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/publiclibrarysg/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/publiclibrarysg">Medium</a>).

        <div class="new-accordion-content">
<p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive* and the respective companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kindle</strong>: Currently, Kindle is not supported.</p>
		<p><strong>Kobo</strong>: A built-in Overdrive feature is available in Kobo eReaders. Please refer to this <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018160953-Which-Kobo-eReaders-have-OverDrive-">link</a> for details. 
</p><p>Log in with your myLibrary ID via the OverDrive integration under Settings &gt; &nbsp;OverDrive* on these Kobo devices to read NLB's eBooks. Titles do not need to be available in Kobo format to be downloaded on a Kobo device. However, only NLB eBooks which are found in the Kobo store can be borrowed directly from these Kobo devices. 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/2194.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read this article</a> for a step-by-step guide on how to borrow ebooks on your Kobo device.
</p>
<p class="end-note">*The Libby app is developed by OverDrive. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Kobo Aura</li>
  <li>Touch 2.0</li>
  <li>Glo</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to do so:</p>

    <p>After October 30 2020, the OverDrive app and OverDrive websites will no longer work on some devices that were released in 2014 or older, as they do not support the TLS 1.2 security protocol. TLS (Transport Layer Security) helps to ensure that your data stays protected.
      </p>
		<p>
			To keep using the OverDrive app and OverDrive websites, you will need to do one of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Update your device's&nbsp;<b>browser</b>&nbsp;to a version that supports TLS 1.2. This will allow you to use the&nbsp;<a href="http://nlb.overdrive.com/">OverDrive website</a>&nbsp;but not the OverDrive app. </li>
			<li><b>If you are using an eReader</b>, use a PC/laptop that supports TLS 1.2 to transfer eBooks to your eReader. Read <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0005.html">OverDrive's article</a> on how to do this.</li>
			<li>If possible, update your device’s operating system to a version that supports TLS 1.2. Android users need to update to Android 5 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en">Google's steps for updating your Android version</a>). Apple users need to update to iOS 5 (see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204">Apple's steps for updating your iOS version</a>).&nbsp;If you are seeing this message on a Windows 7 computer, try installing Windows updates.</li>
			<li>Switch to a device that supports TLS 1.2.</li>
