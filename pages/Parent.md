        <label for="acc4"><i></i>I noticed that you offer a few types of interactive eBooks. What is the difference between the eBooks with narration in Libby (“Read-alongs”) and the animated picture books in Tumblebook Library?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
			<p>Both types of interactive eBooks feature professionally-recorded narration that plays along while you read. The animated picture books in Tumblebook Library are fully-animated videos whilst the 'Read-alongs' in Libby are more like eBooks with the words highlighted as they are read.</p>
