    <label for="acc1">Why will NLB no longer send out SMS notices and reminders</label>
	<div class="new-accordion-content">
		<p>Most patrons are currently receiving notifications about their library transactions through its Mobile App. As such, NLB will stop sending out SMS notices and reminders (except OTP) from <strong>6 February 2023</strong>.</p>
		<p>We understand some patrons may still be receiving alerts through SMS, and we wish to encourage them tap on the NLB Mobile app as a one-stop portal for a fuller suite of services. Through the NLB Mobile App, they can find a host of library-related activities such as searching and browsing of NLB collections, borrowing books and other items, receive notices and reminders, and pay outstanding charges conveniently and securely.</p>

            <li>Tap on “Settings”</li>

            <li>Enable “Notify me via Mobile Notification”</li>
            <li>Ensure that your device is set to display push notifications by enabling the necessary functions in its notification settings.</li>
		</ol>            
		<h4>E-mail</h4>
