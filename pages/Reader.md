			<p><a href="https://go.nlb.gov.sg/nlbmobile">Install or update the NLB Mobile app</a> and take a look at the Librarian’s Pick section, or scroll down to look at other selections. The Librarian’s Pick title will always be available while it’s being featured - no waiting time required!</p>
			<p>You could also launch the Libby app and tap on the 'Library' button located at the bottom left corner of your screen, and scroll down to browse book lists by category,  e.g. thrillers or what’s trending. Just tap on the theme you’re in the mood for, and select 'Refine' &gt; 'Availability' &gt; 'Available Now' if you only want to see titles you can borrow immediately. Let Libby lead you to your next great read!</p>

			<p>How about audiobooks? You can listen to them while doing chores, driving –even right before bed as part of your wind-down routine. Some of these books are read by famous authors themselves, especially autobiographies such as Becoming by Michelle Obama. </p>
		<p><b>Audiobooks in NLB Mobile</b></p>
		<p>When you search for a book in the <a href="https://go.nlb.gov.sg/nlbmobile">NLB Mobile app</a>, you will see an 'Audiobooks' button (alongside 'eBooks', 'Books' and 'AV') near the top of the screen. Tap on 'Audiobooks' to see all results available in audiobook format. Also, when you are browsing a specific title in detail, you can tap on the 'Formats' tab to see if other formats (e.g. eBook/audiobook/book) are available. </p>
		<p><b>Audiobooks in the Libby app</b></p>
		<p>To check if the book you want has an audiobook version, simply launch the Libby app and search for the title. The word “audiobook” will appear underneath your search term, if any are available. Tap on it to see just the titles with audiobook versions.</p>

		<p>If you just want to explore what is available, tap on 'Library' in the Libby app, scroll down to the yellow 'What's Available?' speech bubble and and select 'Available Audiobooks'. If you listen before bedtime, Libby can automatically pause the narration after a specific amount of time set by you. Open the audiobook and drag down the moon icon to set the sleep timer.</p>
		<p>Short stories are also a great way to squeeze in some reading. To find them, go to Library -&gt; Explore -&gt; Subjects -&gt; Short Stories in the Libby app. Some of these are also available as audiobooks!</p>
