<p><q>Sticking with your family is what <i>makes</i> it a family.</q> - Mitch Albom, <i>For One More Day</i>.</p>
<p>Most of us around the world now find ourselves with our families at home, 24/7. 
We have put together some eResources offering some ideas and tips on how families can spend this time together – whether having heart-to-heart conversations, catching up on each other’s lives, uplifting one another’s spirits, sharing household chores, whipping  up delicious and nutritious meals, playing games, creating new family memories (and also knowing when to keep out of each other’s way)!</p>
