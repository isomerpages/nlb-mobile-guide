<div class="acc-body">
  <p>First, sign in with your myLibrary ID.</p> 
      <p>Next, tap on the camera icon on the top left corner of the app to launch the “Scan-to-Borrow” function. Use the in-app camera to scan the NLB barcode on the library item.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you prefer to use the Borrowing Stations at libraries, tap the “eCard” icon (at the top right corner of the NLB Mobile app). Your virtual membership card will appear. Scan the membership QR code at the Borrowing Station to borrow the library items.</p>  
</div></div>

        <label for="acc8">Does scanning the barcode of the library item with the app immediately trigger a checkout?</label>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc10">
        <label for="acc10">How do I borrow eBooks / Audiobooks with this app?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
 <p>Follow these simple steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> In the app, search the catalogue for the titles you want.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> The search results will include both physical books you can find at the actual libraries as well as digital items that match your search terms. Select your desired title.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> If you have signed in using your myLibrary ID, you can select ‘Borrow’ on the title details page.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> After the title has been checked out, you will be prompted to choose among these options: read / listen online, <a href="/get-started-with/libby/">download the item</a> so you can read / listen offline or return to ‘Home’.</p>
<p>You may view all your borrowed eBook / Audiobook titles by selecting ‘Account’, then ‘eBook Loans’. </p>

		<label for="acc11">How do I read the eBooks or listen to the Audiobooks that I have borrowed?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
 <p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step One:</b> In the app, select 'Account’, then ‘eBook Loans’ and tap on the title you want to read or listen to. </p>

<p>If you wish to read or listen offline, you may select the ‘Download’ option. The app will automatically launch a third-party app, Libby, to download the title. If you do not have the Libby app, the NLB Mobile app will prompt you to install it.</p>

        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc12">
        <label for="acc12">How do I return eBooks / Audiobooks?</label>

<div class="acc-body">
  <p>One of the most convenient features of borrowing eBooks / Audiobooks is that they will be returned automatically after 21 days. But if you are done with them before the 21-day loan period is up, you can also return them earlier so that another person can enjoy them sooner.</p>
<p>Just go to ‘Account’, then ‘eBook Loans’, and select the title you wish to return. You will see the option to ‘Return early’ under the title’s cover image.</p>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc13">
        <label for="acc13">How do I reserve eBooks / Audiobooks? And can I cancel the reservation?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
     	  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge by selecting the "Place Hold" option in Libby.  You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. You will receive a notification in your phone when it is your turn to borrow. If you have turned off notifications in Libby's settings or if you don't have the Libby app, we will send you an email. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days. </p>
<p>Once notified, you have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb" target="_blank">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com" target="_blank">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>
</div></div>

  <div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc13a">
        <label for="acc13a">Why do some of your eBooks have limited copies?</label>
                <div class="acc-body">
			<p>
			The publishers require that each eBook copy is only lent to one user at a time - much like a physical book. This business model assures publishers and creators that they will be paid as fairly for digital copies as they are for physical copies. You can <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0720.html">read about the details</a> here from our eBooks vendor, OverDrive.</p>
			<p>If there aren’t any copies available, you can select “Place Hold” or “Reserve” and you will be alerted once it is available. We constantly monitor the waiting lists per title and buy more copies, as far as our budget allows.</p>
			<p>To find books that are available right now, you can browse "Available" categories in Libby, such as <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/spotlight-52/books/page-1">this list of popular but available books for adults</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, eMagazines like Readers' Digest, Wired, HELLO!, Home &amp; Decor and The Economist are always available. Click <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/generated-1033938/page-1">here</a> to see the full list and borrow them.</p>
			<p>We acquire unlimited copies of certain popular titles for a limited period, whenever opportunities arise. For updates, follow us at @publiclibrarysg on our social media channels (we're on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/publiclibrarysg/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/publiclibrarysg/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/publiclibrarysg">Medium</a>).

        <p></p><h5>Reading International eNewspapers and eMagazines</h5><p></p>
<p>NLB Mobile lets you read over 7,000 current eNewspapers and eMagazines from local and international publishers.</p>
<p>First, install the NLB Mobile app and sign in with a myLibrary ID. Next, tap on the ‘eMagazines &amp; eNewspapers’ icon. Because this is a service we subscribe from PressReader, an international digital newsstand, you will be prompted to download the PressReader app if you do not have it. When you launch the PressReader app through NLB Mobile, you can get complimentary access (this is called ‘sponsored access’ in PressReader) to these local and international publications. Do note that this sponsored access is for one hour only. Don’t worry, when the one hour is up, you can re-launch PressReader from NLB Mobile to get sponsored access again. </p>
