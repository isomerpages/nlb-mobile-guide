<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc7">
        <label for="acc7">How can I borrow physical items with the NLB Mobile app?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
  <p>First, sign in with your myLibrary ID.</p> 
      <p>Next, tap on the camera icon on the top left corner of the app to launch the “Scan-to-Borrow” function. Use the in-app camera to scan the NLB barcode on the library item.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you prefer to use the Borrowing Stations at libraries, tap the “eCard” icon (at the top right corner of the NLB Mobile app). Your virtual membership card will appear. Scan the membership QR code at the Borrowing Station to borrow the library items.</p>  
</div></div>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc8">
        <label for="acc8">Does scanning the barcode of the library item with the app immediately trigger a checkout?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
  <p>No, the app will seek your confirmation before the item is checked out.</p>

</div></div>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc9">
        <label for="acc9">How many eBooks / Audiobooks can I borrow?</label>
<div class="acc-body">

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc10">
        <label for="acc10">How do I borrow eBooks / Audiobooks with this app?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
 <p>Follow these simple steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step One:</strong> In the app, search the catalogue for the titles you want.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> The search results will include both physical books you can find at the actual libraries as well as digital items that match your search terms. Select your desired title.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> If you have signed in using your myLibrary ID, you can select &lsquo;Borrow&rsquo; on the title details page.</p>
<p><strong>Step Four:</strong> After the title has been checked out, you will be prompted to choose among these options: read / listen online, <a href="/get-started-with/Libby/">download the item</a> so you can read / listen offline or return to &lsquo;Home&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You may view all your borrowed eBook / Audiobook titles by selecting &lsquo;Account&rsquo;, then &lsquo;eBook Loans&rsquo;. </p>

		<label for="acc11">How do I read the eBooks or listen to the Audiobooks that I have borrowed?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
 <p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step One:</b> In the app, select 'Account&rsquo;, then &lsquo;eBook Loans&rsquo; and tap on the title you want to read or listen to. </p>

<p>If you wish to read or listen offline, you may select the &lsquo;Download&rsquo; option. The app will automatically launch a third-party app, Libby, to download the title. If you do not have the Libby app, the NLB Mobile app will prompt you to install it.</p>

  <div>
        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc12">
        <label for="acc12">How do I return eBooks / Audiobooks?</label>

<div class="acc-body">
  <p>One of the most convenient features of borrowing eBooks / Audiobooks is that they will be returned automatically after 21 days. But if you are done with them before the 21-day loan period is up, you can also return them earlier so that another person can enjoy them sooner.</p>
<p>Just go to &lsquo;Account&rsquo;, then &lsquo;eBook Loans&rsquo;, and select the title you wish to return. You will see the option to &lsquo;Return early&rsquo; under the title&rsquo;s cover image.</p>

  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge. You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / Audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. We will notify you via email or the Libby app when your reservation is ready. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days.</p>     
	<p>You will have three options:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
		<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>

<p>First, sign in with a myLibrary ID. Next, tap the ‘eMagazines & eNewspapers’ icon. Because this is a service we subscribe from PressReader, an international digital newsstand, you will be prompted to download the PressReader app if you do not have it. When you launch the PressReader app through NLB Mobile, you can get complimentary access (this is called ‘sponsored access’ in PressReader) to these local and international publications. Do note that this sponsored access is for one hour only. Don’t worry, when the one hour is up, you can re-launch PressReader from NLB Mobile to get sponsored access again. </p>
<p>In addition, local newspapers such as<em> The Straits Times, The Business Times</em> and <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> can only be accessed when your device is connected to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at any library.</p>
