        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks and audiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> lets you easily check your account and access our resources. You can borrow eBooks / Audiobooks, access eNewspapers / eMagazines and online courses. </p><p>While NLB Mobile lets you read or listen to eBooks / Audiobooks while you are connected to the Internet, it does not have an in-built reader for you to read downloaded eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive. You can borrow and download NLB's eBooks / Audiobooks, so that you can enjoy them even when you are offline. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>

		<p>Yes, you can! </p>
		<p>Libby makes it easy to switch between library cards or between different libraries (e.g. for users who are not only members of NLB but also members of school libraries that use the OverDrive platform). Open the menu, select ‘See Library Cards’ or ‘Add A Library’. </p><p>All your digital checkouts from different cards and libraries are on the same virtual shelf, so you need not switch between libraries or cards to read your books.</p>

        <div class="acc-body">
    	  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge by selecting the "Place Hold" option in Libby.  You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. You will receive a notification in your phone when it is your turn to borrow. If you have turned off notifications in Libby's settings or if you don't have the Libby app, we will send you an email. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days. </p>
<p>Once notified, you have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb" target="_blank">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com" target="_blank">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>
<p>If you fear you may have missed a notification, check your Shelf or Holds in the Libby app. To ensure that your notifications get through, do check your notification settings in Libby (<a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6174.htm" target="_blank">click here to learn how to setup or manage notifications</a>). </p>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc7i">
        <label for="acc7i">Why do some of your eBooks have limited copies?</label>
                <div class="acc-body">
			<p>
			The publishers require that each eBook copy is only lent to one user at a time - much like a physical book. This business model assures publishers and creators that they will be paid as fairly for digital copies as they are for physical copies. You can <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0720.html">read about the details</a> here from our eBooks vendor, OverDrive.</p>
			<p>If there aren’t any copies available, you can select “Place Hold” or “Reserve” and you will be alerted once it is available. We constantly monitor the waiting lists per title and buy more copies, as far as our budget allows.</p>
			<p>To find books that are available right now, you can browse "Available" categories in Libby, such as <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/spotlight-52/books/page-1">this list of popular but available books for adults</a>. In any category in Libby, you can also filter out unavailable books by tapping on Refine > Available Now. We also have this special category called Skip the Line, where you can immediately borrow popular books which otherwise have very long waiting lists. You can borrow such special copies for 7 days. The list is ever-changing and exciting, and you can <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/curated-1029173/page-1">check it out here</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, eMagazines like Readers' Digest, Wired, HELLO!, Home & Decor and The Economist are always available. Click <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb/generated-1033938/page-1">here</a> to see the full list and borrow them.</p>
			<p>We acquire unlimited copies of certain popular titles for a limited period, whenever opportunities arise. For updates, follow us at @publiclibrarysg on our social media channels (we're on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/publiclibrarysg/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/publiclibrarysg/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/publiclibrarysg">Medium</a>).

        <label for="acc7">How do I know if my books have been downloaded to my device?</label>
                <div class="acc-body">
<p>Go to your Shelf in Libby and look at the icon next to the book title. If there is a tick next to the title, it's been downloaded on your device for offline use.</p>
<p>If there's a cloud icon next to the title, it hasn't been downloaded on your device. It'll be streamed when you open it, requires an internet connection to read or listen to, and doesn't take up space on your device.</p>

        <label for="acc7c">What's the difference between Libby and PressReader?</label>
	<div class="acc-body">
		    <p>
		    The difference between PressReader and Libby is that Libby has a smaller, <b>magazines-only</b> collection, but includes some that are not available in PressReader. These are:</p>
		    <ol>
			<li>Allure</li>
			<li>Billboard</li>
			<li>Bon Appetit</li>
			<li>Conde Nast Traveler</li>
			<li>Marie Claire</li>
			<li>Rolling Stone</li>
			<li>The Economist</li>
			<li>The Hollywood Reporter</li>
			<li>The New Yorker</li>
			<li>Wired</li>
		    </ol>
		    <p>
		    If the above titles aren't what you are looking for, try PressReader for a wider selection that includes newspapers too. <a href="/get-started-with/pressreader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> for the PressReader guide.
		    </p>
		<p>
		    The other key difference is that once downloaded, you get to keep PressReader magazines in your device for as long as you want. Libby Magazines are automatically returned after 21 days. After that, feel free to borrow again if you still want them.

        <div class="acc-body">
      <p>If you are using Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, Libby automatically syncs your loans, holds and book progress between devices. Just ensure that your library cards are on each device, and you are connected to the Internet. To manually sync your Shelf, go to Shelf &gt; Actions. Select 'Synchronise Shelf'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using NLB Mobile and Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the loans and holds will be synced across these apps.</li>
<li>Bookmarks from NLB Mobile will not be seen in Libby and vice versa. In NLB Mobile, 'bookmarks' mark your favorite books and eBooks in NLB so that you can search them more easily. In Libby, 'bookmarks' mark pages within your eBook to help you find your way around the eBook.</li>

        <div class="acc-body">
<p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive* and the respective companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kindle</strong>: Currently, Kindle is not supported.</p>
		<p><strong>Kobo</strong>: Yes, you can access NLB's eBooks <b>directly</b>, if you have any of the following models:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Nia,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Kobo Libra H2O,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Kobo Forma,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Kobo Aura ONE,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Kobo Aura Edition 2,</li>
  <li>Kobo Aura H2O Edition 2, or&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Kobo Clara HD devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log in with your myLibrary ID via the OverDrive integration under Settings &gt; &nbsp;OverDrive* on these Kobo devices to read NLB's eBooks. Titles do not need to be available in Kobo format to be downloaded on a Kobo device. However, only NLB eBooks which are found in the Kobo store can be borrowed directly from these Kobo devices. 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/2194.htm" target="_blank">Read this article</a> for a step-by-step guide on how to borrow ebooks on your Kobo device.
</p>
<p class="end-note">*The Libby app interface is not currently available on Kobo - only the OverDrive app interface is supported. However, the selection of eBooks available and what you have borrowed from OverDrive/Libby/NLB Mobile apps would be the same.</p>

<p>For older models of Kobo eReaders such as those below, you will need to transfer NLB's eBooks from a computer using the free Adobe Digital Editions software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Aura</li>
  <li>Touch 2.0</li>
  <li>Glo</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to do so:</p>
<p>i. Connect your eReader to your computer.</p>
<p>ii. Install and authorise Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your computer.</p>
<p>iii. Go to <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com">nlb.overdrive.com</a>. Sign in with your myLibrary ID. Go to My Account -> Loans and click on the "Download EPUB ebook" button under each of the titles you want to read in your eReader. Downloaded eBooks should open automatically in ADE.</p>
<p>iv. In ADE, make sure you’re in the “Library” view. Your eReader should show up under “Devices”. You may need to accept a file-transfer prompt in your eReader in order to appear in ADE.</p>
<p>v. If your eReader is not detected by ADE, you might have to update to the most recent version of ADE. For more information, read this article on

  <p>Are you connected to WiFi? The default setting is to only download titles over WiFi.

    <p>Tap on the underlined <u>20 megabytes</u> to change the maximum file size for automatic downloads. If you wish, you can also switch <b>off</b> "Download only on WiFi" if you want the app to download books automatically over cellular data. Do note that if you do this, you may incur charges from your telco for exceeding your data quota.</p>

      <p class="end-note">eBooks added to the Libby app are in the <i>OverDrive Read</i> or <i>OverDrive Listen</i> formats. If you download a book in EPUB format or an audiobook in MP3 format on the OverDrive app (where the title is not offered in the <i>OverDrive Read</i> or <i>OverDrive Listen</i> formats), it will not display in Libby and cannot be returned early via the Libby app.</p>

  <p>Regular eBooks are always presented in portrait mode on small screens.</p> <p class="end-note"> This is because OverDrive has not settled on a landscape reading experience on small screens that meets their standard. </p><p>For picture books, landscape mode is usually available regardless of screen size.</p>

        <label for="acc24">Why am I seeing a message on the OverDrive app / website saying that my device will no longer be able to access OverDrive?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
    <p>After October 30 2020, the OverDrive app and OverDrive websites will no longer work on some devices that were released in 2014 or older, as they do not support the TLS 1.2 security protocol. TLS (Transport Layer Security) helps to ensure that your data stays protected.
      </p>
		<p>
			To keep using the OverDrive app and OverDrive websites, you will need to do one of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Update your device's <b>browser</b> to a version that supports TLS 1.2. This will allow you to use the <a href="http://nlb.overdrive.com/">OverDrive website</a> but not the OverDrive app. </li>
			<li><b>If you are using an eReader</b>, use a PC/laptop that supports TLS 1.2 to transfer eBooks to your eReader. Read <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0005.html">OverDrive's article</a> on how to do this.</li>
			<li>If possible, update your device’s operating system to a version that supports TLS 1.2. Android users need to update to Android 5 (see <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en">Google's steps for updating your Android version</a>). Apple users need to update to iOS 5 (see <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204">Apple's steps for updating your iOS version</a>). If you are seeing this message on a Windows 7 computer, try installing Windows updates.</li>
			<li>Switch to a device that supports TLS 1.2.</li>
