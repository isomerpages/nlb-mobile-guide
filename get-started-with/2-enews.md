        <label for="acc7">Can I download local newspapers published by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) such as <i>The Straits Times, Business Times</i> and <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i> into my device?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
		<p>You have to use the PressReader app to download SPH newspapers. Do note that these newspapers are not available for <b>download</b> <u>outside of NLB library premises</u> in Singapore due to the geographic restriction set by the publisher.</p>
<p>If you only wish to read SPH newspapers <b>online</b> instead of downloading them, you don't have to be at the library and can read them from <u>anywhere</u>, by logging in with your myLibrary ID at <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/sphnewspapers">go.gov.sg/nlb-enews</a>. 
</p>
<p>To download SPH newspapers using the PressReader app, make sure you are <u>onsite</u> at NLB&rsquo;s libraries with your device, and that your device is <b>connected to NLB's Wireless@SGx</b> networks. </p>
		<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
		<p>Connect your device to the Wireless@SGx network in the library.</p>
		<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
		<p>Launch the PressReader app directly (or go to the NLB Mobile app and tap on the "eNewspapers and eMagazines" icon).</p>
		<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
		<p>Search for the newspaper you want. Tap on the downwards arrow next to the name of the newspaper, or tap on the green "Read" button to download it. To access past issues, tap on the cover of the newspaper, then the calendar icon.</p>
<p>Anything you download in the PressReader app can be accessed using the "Downloaded" button at the bottom of the PressReader app. You can download as many SPH newspapers as you want <b>when you are at the libraries</b>, just as long as your device has enough storage for the downloaded content. You can then continue to read the downloaded content even when you are away from the library premises.</p>

        <div class="acc-body">
		<p>
			<p>PressReader offers both digital newspapers and magazines. Libby has magazines, but not newspapers. The magazine collection in the two apps overlap. Here are some titles found in <b>Libby</b> and not PressReader:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Economist</li>
			<li>The Hollywood Reporter</li>
			<li>The New Yorker</li>
			<li>Bon Appetit</li>
			<li>Wired</li>
			<li>New Scientist</li>
			<li>National Geographic</li>
			<li>Gramophone</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		    If you want any of the above titles, go to Libby. <a href="/get-started-with/libby/#mag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here for the Libby guide.</a>
		    </p>
		<p>
		    The other key difference is that once downloaded, you get to keep PressReader magazines in your device for as long as you want. Libby Magazines are automatically returned after 21 days. After that, just borrow again if you still want them.

<div class="acc-body">
    <p>Sometimes, the app takes a while to refresh. To speed up the refresh, put your finger at the centre of the screen and drag down. When the app is refreshed, you should see a welcome box informing you that you are at an NLB hotspot.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, if you only wish to read SPH newspapers <b>online</b> instead of downloading them, you can use the SPH eNewspaper service instead of PressReader to access the newspapers. Just log in with your myLibrary ID at <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/sphnewspapers">go.gov.sg/nlb-enews</a>.
